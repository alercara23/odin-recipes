       <ul>
        <li>
            Use ground beef with a higher fat content. Fat equals flavor, so 80% to 85% lean ground beef are good choices for chili.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the tomato paste. This is the key to really getting flavor from tomato paste. Plan to cook the tomato paste until it takes on a deep red flavor and is fragrant; the process takes just a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bloom the spices. Same goes for the spices. After adding to the pot, stir to coat the meat with the spices and cook for at least a full minute, at which point the mixture will be very fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Include unsweetened cocoa powder. A tablespoon of this pantry ingredient adds a deep, rich flavor to chili.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish with a spoonful of apple cider vinegar. A teaspoon is all you need. If you find that your chili tastes flat, a little bit of acidity really brightens up and rounds out the flavor.
